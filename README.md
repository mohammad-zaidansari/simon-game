# Simon Game 
The Simon game is a classic electronic memory game where players are required to repeat a sequence of lights and sounds that the game produces. The goal is to see how long you can continue to accurately repeat the sequence as it gets longer and more complex. Here are the basic instructions on how to play the Simon game:

# Simon Game Instructions:

# Set Up:
Place the Simon game in a central location where all players can see and reach it.
Make sure the game has working batteries or is properly powered.

# Turn On:
Press the power button to turn on the Simon game.

# Game Start:
The game will start by lighting up one of the four colored buttons (red, blue, green, and yellow) accompanied by a corresponding sound.

# Memorize the Sequence:
Watch and listen carefully to the sequence of lights and sounds played by Simon.

# Repeat the Sequence:
After Simon has played the sequence, it's your turn. Repeat the sequence by pressing the buttons in the same order.

# Success:
If you correctly repeat the sequence, Simon will add another step to the sequence.

# Failure:
If you make a mistake, Simon will indicate the correct answer, and the game will either end or give you another chance, depending on the game mode.

# Increasing Difficulty:
The game will progressively increase in difficulty by adding more steps to the sequence after each successful round.

# Winning:
The goal is to see how many steps you can correctly repeat. If you successfully repeat a long sequence, you win the game.

# Turn Off:
Once you're finished playing, press exit the Simon game.

# Tips:
Focus on one step at a time and try to memorize the sequence.
Associate each color with a specific sound or mental image to aid in memory.
